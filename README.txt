Welcome to My First Semester University Project!
This project was assigned to me during my first semester of university and serves as a demonstration of my understanding of basic web development concepts. The project consists of two main files: an HTML file that provides the structure of the website, and a CSS file that takes care of the styling and layout. Additionally, three logo files in PNG/JPEG format are included to enhance the visual appeal of the website.

The HTML file includes various elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links that are properly organized to create a coherent structure. The CSS file, on the other hand, utilizes various styling techniques such as color, font, and spacing to make the website visually appealing. By combining these two files, the website comes to life and becomes a functional representation of my knowledge of web development.

This project is not only a demonstration of my understanding of web development concepts, but also serves as a foundation for my future projects. As I continue to grow as a web developer, I will build upon the skills and knowledge I have gained from this project to create more complex and intricate websites.

I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have, as it will help me to continue growing and improving as a web developer. Thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy this project..
